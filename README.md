# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a company. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn and building predictive models, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Data Source

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves exploring the dataset to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships. Key steps in the EDA process include:

- Data Loading and Understanding
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Multivariate Analysis
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization

## Model Training
After gaining insights from EDA, predictive models are trained to forecast customer churn. Commonly used machine learning algorithms for churn prediction include:
- Random Forest
  
## Conclusion
Customer churn analysis and prediction are essential for businesses to maintain customer satisfaction and maximize revenue. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, companies can identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.
